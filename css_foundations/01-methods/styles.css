This CSS stylesheet is an external sheet, as in, the styling syntax 
that is being applied in this document is a separate document to the 
HTML that it applies to. 

This CSS styling applies specifically to the <div> tag in the HTML file. 
THis styling is in accordance to meeting 'The Odin Project: CSS 01 Foundations requirements

div {
    background-color: red; /*The background color of the elements within the <div> tag has been set to RED*/
    color: white; /*The color of the actual elements will have been set to WHITE e.g. Text within a propositional <p> tag(s) will have been set to WHITE*/
    font-weight: 700; /*This will make the font/text to what is known as 'bold', since the value of '700' is equivalent to what is known as 'bold' -
    values between 100-900*/    
    
    text-align: center; /*This is self-explanatory; it assigns any text elements into the middle of the screen width*/
    font-size: 32px; /*The font-size of the (text) elements in the <div> body have been set to 32 pixels*/
}



/*Interestingly, when I used the specifier called 'button' with a different color in this styles.css file, simultaneously with the inline styling still active, 
the inline styling took implicit precedence. This is because inline style take the highest precedence compared to other selectors. 

This has been commented out to meet the Assigment criteria, but it remains here.
