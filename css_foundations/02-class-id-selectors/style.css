/*The class selectors (as denoted by the "." character 
the Id selector (as denoted by the "#" character
The styling of No. 1, 3, 5 are very similar and so a class can be used 
to reuse the styling. Number 1 and 5 are the same so the same class 
identifier can be used and the same styling, however Number 3 is different 
ONLY in its font-size so in the HTML [ourClass font-36], which will use 
the styling from ourClass AND font-36. 

ID's are unique; no two ID's in a HTML document should be the same; hence the 
name of 'ID' similar to a human 'ID' that is unique for every human
Since the content between the <div> tags are quite different in their 
styling, it makes sense to use an ID. 
Each ID's can then be used as a selector to style the content
